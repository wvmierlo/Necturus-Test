# Necturus XML Viewer

This lightweight viewer has been developed as an embeddable tool for online digital scholarly editions, providing the users with the ability to view their files interlinked and paginated. This is currently a beta version.


## Composition

Necturus is in its core a React component and could be placed separately in any web project as a dynamic island or in tandem with other components. The backend support and database adapters are left for the users to decide. A sample code, however, will be uploaded on a separate repository soon.
